1.In order to use the Puppet Provisioner, we need to use a Vagrant box that already has puppet agent pre-installed (not advisable as this gets into the golden image anti-pattern), or we have to install it. 
2.I am going to use the shell provisioner to install the Puppet agent.
3.For the Puppet Provisioner, I specify where to source my modules, which is from a local directory ./site/. Iâ€™ll use the default site manifest location, which is ./manifests/default.pp.
4../manifests/default.pp
5.In the module under site/wesite, the manifests/init.pp
6.In the module under site/database, the manifests/init.pp
7.Test the Solution
